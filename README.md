# Web Scraping

Web Scraping is a great technique that fetches the contents of a web page directly into your code. Then you are free to manipulate the data as you wish.

It is a great tool for data collection. It is often used in data science projects too.
Using Web Scraping you can even download files into your local machine. Every resource on the internet is accessed by a URL after all! ;)

In this repo, I will place projects that solely use the Web Scraping techniques.
For other projects that use web scraping as a tool, I will place a link below:

* <a href="https://github.com/Tanishk-Sharma/Python-Mini-Projects-and-Programs/tree/master/The%20Hangman%20Game#hangman-game">The Hangman Game</a>: uses Web Scraping technique to fetch words!

* <a href="https://github.com/Tanishk-Sharma/Web-Scraping-Mini-Projects/tree/main/Weather%20Data#scraping-weather-data">Weather Data</a>: Scrape all the available attributes of weather data for each day from 2009-01-01 to 2018-10-28 from a website.
